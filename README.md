# Complex Fractal Explorer

A tool to explore fractals generated by complex numbers, coded in C++ and shaders in GLSL.
Made for fun by Kiara :3

Uses emscripten for building to web.

Web uses GLSL v100 shaders, Desktop uses GLSL v330 shaders.

## Fractals

- Mandelbrot set (+Multibrot sets)
- Julia set
- Tricorn (+Multicorn)
- Burning ship
- Newton fractal (with polynomials of the third-, fourth- and fifth-degree)
- P(z) + c (with polynomials of the second- and third-degree)
