# Complex Fractal Explorer

A tool to explore fractals generated by complex numbers, coded in C++ and shaders in GLSL.
Made for fun by Kiara :3

Uses emscripten for building to web.

Web uses GLSL v100 shaders found in assets/shaders/v100, 
and Desktop uses GLSL v330 shaders found in assets/shaders/v330.

## Fractals

- Mandelbrot set (+Multibrot sets)
- Julia set
- Tricorn (+Multicorn)
- Burning ship
- Newton fractal
	- 3rd-degree polynomial
	- 4th-degree polynomial
	- 5th-degree polynomial
	- sin(z)
- P(z) + c
	- 2nd-degree polynomial
	- 3rd-degree polynomial

## Desktop vs Web versions

| Difference | Desktop | Web |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Max Iterations limit | Infinite | 300 |
| Default max iterations | 256 | 128 |
| Shader GLSL version | GLSL v330 core | GLSL v100 |
| Graphics API used by raylib | OpenGL 3.3 | WebGL 1.0 (OpenGL ES 2.0) |
